    level: "Critical",
    title: "Your Business is at Risk",
    summary: "Your business is heavily dependent on you and lacks the foundation for long-term sustainability.",
    description: "Based on your responses, your business would face significant challenges if you were unable to lead it. You're likely working IN the business rather than ON it, and there's little infrastructure in place for continuity. This is common among entrepreneurs who have built successful businesses through sheer effort—but it's also a ticking time bomb for your legacy.",
    recommendations: [
      "Immediately document your most critical processes and client relationships",
      "Identify and begin developing at least one key person who could step up",
      "Create a basic emergency operations plan",

    summary: "You've started building some structure, but significant gaps remain in your business's ability to thrive without you.",
    description: "Your business has some elements of sustainability, but you're still the linchpin. You may have a vision but lack the systems, team, or succession plan to make it reality. Many business owners stay stuck at this level for years—working hard but never quite achieving the freedom they deserve.",
    recommendations: [
      "Develop a clear 3-year vision and share it with your team",
      "Create standard operating procedures for your top 10 recurring tasks",
      "Build a leadership team or identify high-potential employees to develop",
      "Get a professional business valuation to understand your starting point",

    title: "Making Progress",
    summary: "You're on the right track with some solid foundations, but there's room to strengthen your legacy infrastructure.",
    description: "You've done meaningful work to build a more sustainable business. You likely have some systems, a capable team, and at least a rough idea of your exit strategy. However, there are still areas where you're the bottleneck or where your plans need more development. The good news: you're closer to legacy-ready than most business owners.",
    recommendations: [
      "Refine your succession plan with specific timelines and candidates",
      "Strengthen your leadership team's decision-making authority",
      "Document and optimize your remaining owner-dependent processes",

    description: "You've built something remarkable—a business that can thrive beyond your daily involvement. You have vision, systems, leadership, and succession planning in place. Your focus now should be on fine-tuning, maximizing value, and ensuring your legacy unfolds exactly as you envision. You're in the top tier of business owners when it comes to legacy readiness.",
    recommendations: [
      "Optimize your business for maximum value before any transition",
      "Mentor your successor(s) and gradually transfer more responsibility",
