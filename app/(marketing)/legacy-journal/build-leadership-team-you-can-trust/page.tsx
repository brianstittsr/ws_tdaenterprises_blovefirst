              The difference between a business that scales and one that stalls 
              often comes down to one thing: the leadership team. Here's how 
              to build yours and finally break through the ceiling that's been 
              holding you back.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              You've probably heard the saying: "The bottleneck is always at 
              the top of the bottle." For most business owners, that bottleneck 
              is you. Not because you're incompetent—quite the opposite. You're 
              too capable, too involved, and too essential.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              The businesses that scale to 8, 9, or 10 figures have something 
              in common: they have leadership teams that function without the 
              founder's constant involvement. And the owners of those businesses? 
              They have something priceless: peace of mind.

              The Problem: Why Most Owners Can't Let Go
            </h2>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Before we talk about how to build your leadership team, let's 
              address the elephant in the room: trust. Most owners can't build 
              a strong team because they can't trust anyone to do the job as 
              well as they can.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              And you know what? They're usually right—at first. No one will 
              care about your business as much as you do. No one will have your 
              institutional knowledge. No one will make decisions exactly like 
              you would.

                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Skills can be taught. Values can't. Before you hire for 
                  competence, hire for character. Ask yourself: Would I trust 
                  this person with my reputation? Would they make decisions 
                  aligned with what matters most to me?

                  <strong>Action Step:</strong> Define your top 5 non-negotiable

                  before making any leadership hire.

                  a culture where failures are learning opportunities, not

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Building a trusted leadership team requires you to change how you 
              operate. You need to shift from being the best doer in the company 
              to being the best leader of leaders. This is uncomfortable. It 
              requires letting go of control and embracing a new identity.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              But here's what awaits you on the other side: a business that 
              grows without your constant presence. A team that solves problems 
              without escalating everything to you. And most importantly, the 
              freedom to focus on what only you can do—vision, strategy, and 
              building relationships.

              The Bottom Line
            </h2>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Your business will never scale beyond your personal capacity 
              unless you build a leadership team you trust. The good news? 
              Trust can be built systematically. It requires intention, 
              investment, and a willingness to let go—but the rewards are 
              transformational.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
              Don't wait until you're burned out or until a crisis forces 
              your hand. Start building your leadership team today.
