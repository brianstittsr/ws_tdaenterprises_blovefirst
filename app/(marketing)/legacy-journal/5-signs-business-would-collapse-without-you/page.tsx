              If you can't take a two-week vacation without your phone blowing up, 
              you don't have a business—you have a job. And worse, it's a job that 
              owns you instead of the other way around.

              Every business owner dreams of building something that lasts. But 
              here's the harsh reality: most businesses are held together by the 
              sheer willpower of their founder. Remove that founder, and the whole 
              thing crumbles like a house of cards.

              When something goes wrong—and something always goes wrong—does

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              This is a classic trap. You think you're being "customer-focused"

              really doing is creating a business that can't scale—and can't be

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              The most valuable businesses have strong customer relationships

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              When was the last time you took a two-week vacation where you 
              didn't check email, didn't take calls, and didn't worry about 
              what was happening back at the office? If you can't remember, 
              your business owns you.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Here's a challenge: Book a two-week trip somewhere with no

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              If someone offered to buy your business today, would you know 
              what it's actually worth? Most owners don't. And the ones who 
              are overly dependent on the founder are almost always 
              disappointed by the valuation.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              A business that depends on its owner is worth less than one 
              that doesn't. It's that simple. Buyers pay premiums for 
              businesses that run themselves. They discount—or walk away 
              from—businesses that can't survive without the founder.

            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Here's the truth: You didn't start your business to create
